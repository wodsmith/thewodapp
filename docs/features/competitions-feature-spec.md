# Competition Management Feature Specification

**Version:** 1.1 (Team-Based Optimization)
**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** Design Phase - Optimized

---

## üöÄ Key Optimizations Summary

This specification has been **optimized** to maximize reuse of existing infrastructure:

### ‚úÖ Team Membership System (NEW)
- **Eliminated** `competition_registration_members` table
- Competition auto-creates a dedicated team for athlete management
- Athletes join as team members with "Competitor" role
- Owners/managers handle all admin tasks with single `manage_competition` permission
- Reuses all existing team membership features (invites, roles, permissions)

### ‚úÖ Tables Reduced: 5 ‚Üí 4
**Original Plan:** 5 new tables
**Optimized Plan:** 4 new tables
- ‚úÖ `competitions` (with `competitionTeamId` link)
- ‚úÖ `competition_registrations` (with `membershipId` link)
- ‚úÖ `competition_sponsors`
- ‚úÖ `competition_leaderboard_cache`
- ‚ùå ~~`competition_registration_members`~~ ‚Üí **Replaced by** `team_membership`

### ‚úÖ New Roles & Permissions
- `competition_manager` - Full competition admin
- `competitor` - Registered athlete (for tracking/waivers)
- **1 streamlined permission** (owner/manager only)

### ‚úÖ Public Access by Default
- All competition pages are **publicly accessible**:
  - Competition details, schedule, divisions, workouts
  - Athlete list and leaderboards
  - No authentication required for viewing
- Roles/permissions only control **management actions** (editing, approving, logging results)
- Competitor role is for tracking registration/waivers, not access control

## Overview

This specification defines how to integrate competition management capabilities into our existing workout management system. Rather than building a parallel system, we'll **leverage existing infrastructure** for scaling, scheduling, workouts, AND team management while adding competition-specific features.

### Goals
- Enable teams to create and manage CrossFit-style competitions
- Support 15+ divisions using existing scaling system
- Reuse scheduling infrastructure for multi-day events
- **Leverage existing team membership system for athlete management**
- Track registrations, results, and leaderboards
- Maintain multi-tenant isolation
- Minimize new tables while maximizing existing table reuse

### Key Innovation: Team-Based Competition Management

When a competition is created, a **dedicated team** is automatically generated:
- Competition creator becomes the team **owner**
- Athletes register and join as **team members** with "Competitor" role
- Additional admins can be added with "Competition Manager" role
- Eliminates need for separate `competition_registration_members` table

---

## Team Membership System for Athlete Management ‚úÖ

### Automatic Team Creation

When a competition is created:

```typescript
// 1. Create competition
const competition = await createCompetition({
  name: "MWFC 2025",
  // ... other fields
})

// 2. Auto-create dedicated team
const competitionTeam = await createTeam({
  name: "MWFC 2025 - Athletes",
  slug: "mwfc-2025-athletes",
  description: "Competition team for athlete management",
  isPersonalTeam: 0,
  settings: JSON.stringify({
    competitionId: competition.id,
    isCompetitionTeam: true,
  })
})

// 3. Link competition to team
await updateCompetition(competition.id, {
  competitionTeamId: competitionTeam.id  // New field
})

// 4. Add creator as owner
await addTeamMembership({
  teamId: competitionTeam.id,
  userId: creatorUserId,
  roleId: SYSTEM_ROLES_ENUM.OWNER,
  isSystemRole: 1,
})
```

### Competition-Specific Roles & Permissions

**New System Roles** (added to `SYSTEM_ROLES_ENUM`):
```typescript
export const SYSTEM_ROLES_ENUM = {
  OWNER: "owner",
  ADMIN: "admin",
  MEMBER: "member",
  GUEST: "guest",

  // Competition-specific roles
  COMPETITION_MANAGER: "competition_manager",  // Full competition admin
  COMPETITOR: "competitor",                   // Registered athlete
}
```

**Note:** No separate "Judge" role needed - owners/managers handle all admin tasks including result logging.

**New Permissions** (added to `TEAM_PERMISSIONS`):

*Simplified from 10+ granular permissions to just 1!*

```typescript
export const TEAM_PERMISSIONS = {
  // ... existing permissions ...

  // Competition Permission (only 1 needed!)
  MANAGE_COMPETITION: "manage_competition",      // Full competition control
                                                 // Includes: settings, schedule, divisions,
                                                 // workouts, sponsors, venue details,
                                                 // registrations, results, leaderboard

  // Note: No separate permissions needed - owners/managers do everything
  // No view permissions needed - competitions are PUBLIC
}
```

**Why only 1 permission?**
- `manage_competition` covers EVERYTHING: setup, registrations, results, leaderboard
- Owners and managers handle all admin tasks (no separate judge role needed)
- Competitors have no special permissions (just team membership for tracking)

**Default Role Permissions:**

| Permission | Owner | Competition Manager | Competitor | Public |
|------------|-------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| **Full Competition Management** |
| `manage_competition` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| ‚Ü≥ *Includes: ALL admin tasks - setup, schedule, divisions, workouts, sponsors, registrations, results, leaderboard* |
| **Public Access (No Permission Required)** |
| View everything (details, schedule, divisions, workouts, leaderboard, athletes) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

**Role Summary:**
- **Owner/Competition Manager:** Full control (single `manage_competition` permission for everything)
- **Competitor:** Team member for registration tracking and waivers (no special permissions)
- **Public:** Can view all competition data

**Note:** No separate judge role needed - owners/managers handle all admin tasks including logging results, approving registrations, and checking in athletes.

### Athlete Registration Flow

```typescript
// 1. Athlete registers for competition (user must be logged in)
const registration = await registerForCompetition({
  competitionId: "comp_abc",
  divisionId: "slvl_001",  // Co-Ed RX
  teamName: "The Crushers",
  athleteUserId: currentUserId,
})

// 2. Add athlete to competition team with Competitor role
await addTeamMembership({
  teamId: competition.competitionTeamId,
  userId: currentUserId,
  roleId: SYSTEM_ROLES_ENUM.COMPETITOR,
  isSystemRole: 1,
})

// 3. Link membership to registration
await updateRegistration(registration.id, {
  membershipId: membership.id  // New field
})

// Note: Athlete can now submit results and waiver, but competition is PUBLIC
```

### Benefits

‚úÖ **No new members table** - Leverage existing `team_membership`
‚úÖ **Unified permission system** - Same role/permission system as rest of app
‚úÖ **Built-in features** - Invitations, role changes, member management all work
‚úÖ **Consistent UX** - Team management UI works for competitions
‚úÖ **Audit trail** - Existing createdAt/updatedAt tracking on memberships
‚úÖ **Public by default** - Anyone can view competitions without authentication

---

## Existing Schema Leverage

### 1. Scaling System for Divisions ‚úÖ

**Current Tables:**
- `scaling_groups` - Competition-specific scaling groups
- `scaling_levels` - Individual divisions (e.g., "Co-Ed RX", "Men's Intermediate")
- `workout_scaling_descriptions` - Division-specific workout variations

**How We'll Use It:**

```typescript
// Create a competition scaling group
const competitionScalingGroup = {
  id: "sgrp_mwfc_2025",
  title: "MWFC 2025 Divisions",
  description: "Mountain West Fitness Championship divisions",
  teamId: "team_xyz",
  isDefault: 0,
  isSystem: 0,
}

// Create scaling levels as divisions
const divisions = [
  { id: "slvl_001", scalingGroupId: "sgrp_mwfc_2025", label: "Co-Ed - RX", position: 0 },
  { id: "slvl_002", scalingGroupId: "sgrp_mwfc_2025", label: "Co-Ed - Intermediate", position: 1 },
  { id: "slvl_003", scalingGroupId: "sgrp_mwfc_2025", label: "Co-Ed - Rookie", position: 2 },
  { id: "slvl_004", scalingGroupId: "sgrp_mwfc_2025", label: "Men's - RX", position: 3 },
  // ... 15 total divisions
]
```

**Benefits:**
- No new division tables needed
- Reuse existing UI components for managing levels
- Workout scaling descriptions work out of the box
- Consistent with existing data model

**New Metadata Needed:**
We'll add a JSON `metadata` field to `scaling_groups` to store competition-specific info:

```typescript
{
  competitionId: "comp_abc123",          // Link to competition
  divisionType: "team" | "individual" | "pairs",
  teamSize: 2,
  gender: "mixed" | "male" | "female",
  ageGroup: "open" | "masters" | "teen",
  skillLevel: "rx" | "intermediate" | "rookie",
  movementExpectations: [...],          // Movement requirements
  workingLoads: {...}                   // Weight standards
}
```

---

### 2. Scheduling System for Events ‚úÖ

**Current Tables:**
- `locations` - Venues and stages
- `scheduled_classes` - Time-based scheduling with start/end times
- `class_catalog` - Class types (can represent heats/events)

**How We'll Use It:**

Competition events are essentially scheduled activities with:
- **Location** ‚Üí Competition stage/field (e.g., "Main Stage")
- **Class Catalog** ‚Üí Heat type or workout session
- **Start/End Time** ‚Üí Event windows
- **Coach** ‚Üí Judge/event staff (optional)

```typescript
// Create location for competition venue
const venue = {
  id: "loc_canyon_county",
  teamId: "team_xyz",
  name: "Main Stage",
  capacity: 400,
}

// Schedule a workout heat using scheduled_classes
const workoutHeat = {
  id: "schd_001",
  scheduleId: "sched_mwfc_day1",     // Daily schedule
  classCatalogId: "cat_workout_heat", // Heat type
  locationId: "loc_canyon_county",    // Stage
  coachId: null,                      // Optional judge assignment
  startTime: new Date("2025-10-10T09:00:00"),
  endTime: new Date("2025-10-10T12:33:00"),
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reuse existing scheduling UI
- Time conflict detection built-in
- Location management already exists
- Can assign judges like coaches

**Extension Needed:**
Add a `metadata` JSON field to `scheduled_classes` for competition context:

```typescript
{
  competitionId: "comp_abc123",
  workoutId: "wkt_sawtooth",
  divisionId: "slvl_001",
  heatNumber: 1,
  sponsorId: "spn_scheels"  // Presented by sponsor
}
```

---

### 3. Workouts System ‚úÖ

**Current Tables:**
- `workouts` - Workout definitions
- `results` - Athlete results with `scalingLevelId`
- `workout_scaling_descriptions` - Per-division workout variations

**How We'll Use It:**

Competition workouts are just regular workouts with competition context:

```typescript
const competitionWorkout = {
  id: "wkt_sawtooth",
  name: "Sawtooth",
  description: "... workout description ...",
  scope: "private",               // Team-specific competition
  scheme: "time-with-cap",
  teamId: "team_xyz",
  scalingGroupId: "sgrp_mwfc_2025",  // Links to competition divisions
}

// Division-specific variations
const rxVersion = {
  workoutId: "wkt_sawtooth",
  scalingLevelId: "slvl_001",  // Co-Ed RX
  description: "Thrusters 95/65, Chest-to-Bar Pull-ups"
}

const intermediateVersion = {
  workoutId: "wkt_sawtooth",
  scalingLevelId: "slvl_002",  // Co-Ed Intermediate
  description: "Thrusters 75/55, Pull-ups"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Workout builder already exists
- Scaling variations already supported
- Results tracking already built
- Movement library available

---

## New Schema Requirements

While we leverage existing tables, we need **4 new tables** for competition-specific features:

1. **`competitions`** - Core competition metadata (with `competitionTeamId` link)
2. **`competition_registrations`** - Team/athlete registration (with `membershipId` link)
3. **`competition_sponsors`** - Sponsor management
4. **`competition_leaderboard_cache`** - Performance optimization

**Eliminated:** `competition_registration_members` - replaced by existing `team_membership` table

---

## Database Schema Design

  "competition_sponsors",
  {
    ...commonColumns,
    id: text("id")
      .primaryKey()
      .$defaultFn(() => createCompetitionSponsorId())

  (table) => [
    index("competition_sponsors_comp_idx").on(table.competitionId),
    index("competition_sponsors_team_idx").on(table.teamId),
  ]
)
```

---

### 3. Competition Registrations Table

**Purpose:** Track team/athlete registrations (links to team_membership for athletes)

```typescript
export const competitionRegistrationsTable = sqliteTable(
  "competition_registrations",
  {
    ...commonColumns,
    id: text("id")
      .primaryKey()
      .$defaultFn(() => createCompetitionRegistrationId())

      .notNull()
      .references(() => teamMembershipTable.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }), // Link to athlete's membership in competitionTeam

    // Team Info (for display purposes - team of competitors, e.g., "The Crushers")
    teamName: text("team_name", { length: 255 }).notNull(),
    affiliateGym: text("affiliate_gym", { length: 255 }),

    // Registration
    registrationNumber: integer("registration_number").notNull(), // Auto-increment per competition

    index("competition_registrations_number_idx").on(
      table.competitionId,
      table.registrationNumber
    ),
  ]
)
```

**Note:** Athlete details (name, email, etc.) are stored in `userTable` and linked via `team_membership` ‚Üí `userId`. No separate members table needed!

        workoutId: string
        workoutNumber: number
        points: number
        rank: number
        result: string // Raw result: "12:34", "100 reps", etc.
      }>
    >(),

    // Last Updated
    lastCalculatedAt: integer("last_calculated_at", { mode: "timestamp" }).notNull(),

    index("competition_leaderboard_cache_division_idx").on(table.scalingLevelId),
    index("competition_leaderboard_cache_rank_idx").on(
      table.competitionId,
      table.scalingLevelId,
      table.overallRank
    ),
    index("competition_leaderboard_cache_lookup_idx").on(

### Key Relationships

1. **Competition ‚Üí Competition Team (NEW)**
   - `competitions.competitionTeamId` ‚Üí `teamTable.id` (auto-created)
   - Competition team has many `team_membership` records with roles:

5. **Registration ‚Üí Team Membership (NEW)**
   - `competition_registrations.membershipId` ‚Üí `team_membership.id`
   - `team_membership.userId` ‚Üí `userTable.id` (athlete details)
   - Athlete has "Competitor" role in competition team
   - No separate members table needed!

6. **Registration ‚Üí Results**
   - Athletes log results to existing `results` table
   - `results.userId` matches athlete from registration
   - `results.scalingLevelId` matches `competition_registrations.scalingLevelId`
   - Results have `results.scheduledWorkoutInstanceId` or custom metadata

7. **Leaderboard Calculation**
   - Query `results` grouped by `scalingLevelId` and `userId`

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** Enable basic competition creation and division management

1. **Database Migration**
   - Create 4 new tables (competitions, sponsors, registrations, leaderboard cache)
   - Add `metadata` JSON field to `scaling_groups` for competition context
   - Add `metadata` JSON field to `scheduled_classes` for heat info
   - Add new system roles to `SYSTEM_ROLES_ENUM`: `competition_manager`, `judge`, `competitor`
   - Add new permissions to `TEAM_PERMISSIONS` for competition management

2. **Seed Competition Scaling Group**
   - Create default system scaling group for competitions
   - Pre-seed common divisions (RX, Intermediate, Rookie for Co-Ed/Men's/Women's)

3. **Automatic Team Creation Workflow**
   - When competition is created, auto-generate dedicated team:
     - Team name: "{Competition Name} - Athletes"
     - Slug: "{competition-slug}-athletes"
     - Settings: `{competitionId, isCompetitionTeam: true}`
   - Add creator as team `owner`

---

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Schema Migration

**Create Migration:**
```bash
pnpm db:generate create_competitions_tables
```

**Migration File:**
```typescript
// src/db/migrations/XXXX_create_competitions_tables.ts

import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm'

// Create new tables:
// - competitions
// - competition_sponsors
// - competition_registrations
// - competition_leaderboard_cache

// Add metadata column to scaling_groups (if not exists)
// Add metadata column to scheduled_classes (if not exists)
```

**Apply Migration:**
```bash
pnpm db:migrate:dev  # Local
pnpm db:migrate:prod # Production
```

---

### Step 2: Seed Data

**Create System Scaling Group for Competitions:**
```typescript
// src/db/seed-competition-divisions.ts

const systemCompetitionGroup = {
  id: 'sgrp_competition_default',
  title: 'Default Competition Divisions',
  description: 'System-wide competition division templates',
  teamId: null, // System group
  isDefault: 0,
  isSystem: 1,
}

const defaultDivisions = [
  { label: 'Co-Ed - RX', position: 0, metadata: { teamSize: 2, gender: 'mixed', skillLevel: 'rx' } },
  { label: 'Co-Ed - Intermediate', position: 1, metadata: { teamSize: 2, gender: 'mixed', skillLevel: 'intermediate' } },
  { label: 'Co-Ed - Rookie', position: 2, metadata: { teamSize: 2, gender: 'mixed', skillLevel: 'rookie' } },
  { label: "Men's - RX", position: 3, metadata: { teamSize: 2, gender: 'male', skillLevel: 'rx' } },
  { label: "Men's - Intermediate", position: 4, metadata: { teamSize: 2, gender: 'male', skillLevel: 'intermediate' } },
  { label: "Men's - Rookie", position: 5, metadata: { teamSize: 2, gender: 'male', skillLevel: 'rookie' } },
  { label: "Women's - RX", position: 6, metadata: { teamSize: 2, gender: 'female', skillLevel: 'rx' } },
  { label: "Women's - Intermediate", position: 7, metadata: { teamSize: 2, gender: 'female', skillLevel: 'intermediate' } },
  { label: "Women's - Rookie", position: 8, metadata: { teamSize: 2, gender: 'female', skillLevel: 'rookie' } },
  { label: "Masters Co-Ed - RX", position: 9, metadata: { teamSize: 2, gender: 'mixed', ageGroup: 'masters', skillLevel: 'rx' } },
  // ... 15 total
]
```

---

### Step 3: Feature Flag

Enable competition features gradually:

```typescript
// src/constants.ts

export const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  COMPETITIONS_ENABLED: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_COMPETITIONS === 'true',
  COMPETITION_REGISTRATION_ENABLED: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_COMPETITION_REGISTRATION === 'true',
  COMPETITION_LIVE_LEADERBOARD: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_COMPETITION_LIVE_LEADERBOARD === 'true',
}
```

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Reuse Over Rebuild ‚úÖ
- Leverage `scaling_groups` + `scaling_levels` for divisions
- Use `scheduled_classes` for event scheduling
- Store results in existing `results` table
- Extend with JSON `metadata` fields instead of new columns

### 2. Multi-Tenancy ‚úÖ
- All tables have `teamId` for data isolation
- Competitions are team-scoped
- Public competitions still belong to organizing team

### 3. Flexibility ‚úÖ
- JSON metadata for competition-specific context
- Reusable scaling groups across multiple competitions
- Support for individual, pairs, and team divisions

### 4. Performance ‚úÖ
- Leaderboard cache table for fast queries
- Indexes on common filters (competitionId, divisionId, status)
- Pre-computed ranks and points

### 5. Future-Proof ‚úÖ
- Competition series support (via metadata)
- Multi-venue events (via locations)
- Heat management (via scheduled_classes)
- Judge assignments (via coachId in scheduled_classes)
