# Core Concepts

Understanding the key concepts in WodSmith will help you make the most of the platform.

## Teams

Teams are the fundamental organizational unit in WodSmith. Each gym or fitness community operates as a team with:

- **Members** - Athletes who participate in workouts
- **Coaches** - Staff who create and manage programming
- **Admins** - Full access to team settings and billing

A user can belong to multiple teams, making it easy for coaches and athletes to work with different gyms.

## Workouts

Workouts in WodSmith support all common CrossFit formats:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AMRAP** | As Many Rounds/Reps As Possible in a time cap |
| **For Time** | Complete the work as fast as possible |
| **EMOM** | Every Minute On the Minute |
| **Tabata** | Interval training (20s work / 10s rest) |
| **Strength** | Lifting sessions with sets and reps |

Each workout can include multiple movements, scaling options, and detailed instructions.

## Programming

Programming allows you to organize workouts into structured training plans:

- **Tracks** - Named programs (e.g., "Competition Prep", "Foundations")
- **Schedules** - When workouts appear on your gym's calendar
- **Templates** - Reusable workout patterns

## Scoring

WodSmith supports comprehensive scoring for all workout types:

- Time-based scores (mm:ss format)
- Round + rep counts for AMRAPs
- Weight lifted for strength work
- Custom scoring for specialized workouts

Athletes can log their scores and track progress over time.

## Competitions

Run competitions and throwdowns with:

- Athlete registration and divisions
- Heat management
- Real-time leaderboards
