The registrations table displays:

- **Division** - The division they registered for

- **Registered** - Registration date

## Filtering by Division

2. Select a division to filter

The dropdown shows the count of registrations per division (e.g., "RX (10)").

<!-- FEATURE NOT FOUND: Registration Statuses (Confirmed, Pending, Waitlisted, Cancelled) - The current implementation shows all registrations without status indicators -->

<!-- FEATURE NOT FOUND: Approving/Rejecting Registrations - There are no Approve or Reject buttons. All registrations are auto-confirmed. -->

<!-- FEATURE NOT FOUND: Waitlist Management - There is no waitlist feature in this application. Divisions do not have capacity limits and all registrations are immediately accepted. -->

<!-- FEATURE NOT FOUND: Refunds - There is no refund functionality in the registration management interface. Refunds would need to be processed directly through your payment provider. -->

## Exporting Registrations

Click **Export CSV** to download all registrations including custom question answers.
