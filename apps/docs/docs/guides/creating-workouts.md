# Creating Workouts

This guide walks you through creating different types of workouts in WodSmith.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- Coach or Admin role on your team
- Basic understanding of [workout types](/features/workouts)

## Creating an AMRAP

Let's create a classic CrossFit AMRAP workout.

### Step 1: Start New Workout

1. Navigate to **Workouts** in the sidebar
2. Click the **New Workout** button
3. Select **AMRAP** as the workout type

### Step 2: Configure Time Cap

Enter the time cap for your AMRAP:
- Common options: 10, 12, 15, 20 minutes
- Custom times are supported

### Step 3: Add Movements

Add movements to your workout:

1. Click **Add Movement**
2. Search for the movement (e.g., "Pull-up")
3. Enter the rep count
4. Repeat for each movement

Example AMRAP structure:
```
12 Minute AMRAP:
- 10 Pull-ups
- 15 Push-ups
- 20 Air Squats
```

### Step 4: Add Scaling Options

Create scaling options for different ability levels:

1. Click **Add Scaling**
2. Name the scale (e.g., "Scaled", "Foundations")
3. Specify movement substitutions

### Step 5: Save and Publish

1. Add any notes or instructions
2. Click **Save as Draft** to save without publishing
3. Or click **Publish** to make visible to athletes

## Creating a "For Time" Workout

### Step 1: Select Workout Type

1. Click **New Workout**
2. Select **For Time**

### Step 2: Structure Your Workout

For Time workouts can be structured as:

**Simple format:**
```
21-15-9
Thrusters (95/65)
Pull-ups
```

**Round-based:**
```
3 Rounds:
- 400m Run
- 21 Kettlebell Swings
- 12 Pull-ups
```

### Step 3: Set Time Cap (Optional)

Add a time cap for safety:
- Enter maximum time allowed
- Athletes finishing over cap get "CAP + X" score

### Step 4: Configure Weights

Specify prescribed weights:
- RX weights (e.g., 95/65 for thrusters)
- Scaled weights (e.g., 65/45)

## Creating a Strength Session

### Step 1: Select Strength Type

1. Click **New Workout**
2. Select **Strength**

### Step 2: Add Lifts

Add your lifting movements:

```
Back Squat
5x5 @ 80% 1RM

Romanian Deadlift
3x10 @ moderate weight
```

### Step 3: Configure Scoring

Choose how athletes log their scores:
- **Max weight** - Track heaviest successful lift
- **Total volume** - Sum of all weight lifted
- **Check-in** - Just mark as completed

## Tips for Great Workouts

### Write Clear Instructions

- Specify movement standards
- Include time domains
- Note any special equipment

### Use Consistent Formatting

```
Good: "21-15-9 Thrusters and Pull-ups"
Better: "21-15-9
         Thrusters (95/65)
         Pull-ups"
```

### Consider All Athletes

- Always provide scaling options
- Think about equipment availability
- Consider space requirements
