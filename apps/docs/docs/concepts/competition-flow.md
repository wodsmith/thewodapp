# The Competition Day Flow

Understanding how a WODsmith competition unfolds from setup through final results.

## The Competition Lifecycle

Every competition follows a predictable lifecycle:

```
Setup → Registration → Preparation → Event Day → Results
```

Each phase has distinct activities and transitions. Understanding this flow helps organizers plan effectively and athletes know what to expect.

## Phase 1: Setup

### Creating the Foundation

Before athletes can register, organizers must define the competition structure:

- **What**: Events and workouts
- **Who**: Divisions and capacity
- **When**: Dates and schedule
- **Where**: Location details
- **How much**: Entry fees

This phase feels administrative, but decisions here cascade through everything that follows. A well-planned setup prevents problems on event day.

### Why Divisions Come First

Experienced organizers configure divisions before events. The reason: events often have division-specific standards.

Consider "Fran": RX athletes might do 95/65 lb thrusters, while Scaled does 65/45. Defining divisions first allows event configuration to reference them.

## Phase 2: Registration

### Opening the Gates

Registration transforms a plan into a real event. Athletes discover the competition, evaluate whether to participate, and commit.

### The Registration Experience

From an athlete's perspective, registration should feel:

- **Informative**: Clear about what they're signing up for
- **Simple**: Minimal friction to complete
- **Confirming**: Immediate acknowledgment of success

WODsmith's registration flow prioritizes these qualities while collecting necessary information.

### Why Waivers Matter

Digital waivers protect both organizers and athletes. By integrating waivers into registration:

- No paper shuffling on event day
- Legal documentation captured with timestamps
- Athletes review terms when attention is high

## Phase 3: Preparation

### From Registrations to Heats

Once registration closes, preparation begins. The central task: organizing athletes into heats.

#### Heat Scheduling Logic

Heat scheduling balances multiple constraints:

- **Equipment**: Available lanes or stations
- **Time**: Total event duration
- **Experience**: Don't make athletes wait hours between events
- **Fairness**: Comparable conditions across heats

WODsmith's auto-generation considers these factors, though organizers can (and should) make manual adjustments.

### Workout Reveals

Many competitions keep workouts secret until close to event day. This builds excitement and prevents over-specialization in training.

WODsmith supports timed reveals: workouts become visible to athletes at a scheduled moment. Organizers see them earlier for planning.

## Phase 4: Event Day

### Check-In: The Starting Line

Event day begins with check-in. Athletes confirm their presence, receive any physical materials (bibs, heat sheets), and understand the day's flow.

Check-in serves several purposes:

- **Verification**: Athlete is present and ready
- **Updates**: Last-minute schedule changes communicated
- **Atmosphere**: Transition from arrival to competition mindset

### The Heat Cycle

Each event follows a heat cycle:

1. **Warm-up**: Athletes prepare in designated areas
2. **Staging**: Athletes move to competition floor
3. **Briefing**: Standards and timing reviewed
4. **Execution**: The actual workout
5. **Scoring**: Judges record results
6. **Transition**: Floor reset for next heat

This cycle repeats throughout the day. Good organizers maintain rhythm—athletes know what comes next.

### Scoring Under Pressure

Event day scoring must be fast and accurate. Delays frustrate athletes and spectators. Errors undermine trust.

WODsmith's real-time scoring addresses both concerns:

- Judges enter scores immediately after each heat
- Leaderboard updates automatically
- Athletes can verify their own scores

### The Leaderboard as Storytelling

Live leaderboards aren't just rankings—they tell the competition's story. Close battles emerge. Underdogs rise. Favorites stumble.

This narrative drives engagement. Athletes and spectators follow along, discuss standings, and anticipate upcoming drama.

## Phase 5: Results

### Finalization

When the last event completes, results transition from live to official. This moment matters:

- Rankings become permanent
- Awards are determined
- Athletes share their placement

WODsmith's finalization process locks scores and enables official exports.

### After the Event

The competition's impact extends beyond event day:

- Athletes reference their finishes in training motivation
- Organizers analyze data for future improvements
- The community shares results and memories

## What Can Go Wrong

Understanding the flow helps anticipate problems:

| Phase        | Common Issues            | Prevention           |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Setup        | Incomplete configuration | Checklist review     |
| Registration | Capacity exceeded        | Waitlist enabled     |
| Preparation  | Schedule conflicts       | Buffer time built in |
| Event Day    | Scoring delays           | Judge training       |
| Results      | Disputed scores          | Clear standards      |

## The Athlete Experience

From an athlete's perspective, a well-run competition feels:

- **Organized**: Knowing where to be and when
- **Fair**: Same standards applied equally
- **Exciting**: Competition energy and atmosphere
- **Respected**: Their effort acknowledged

WODsmith's features support each of these feelings through thoughtful design.
