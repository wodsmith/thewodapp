# The Division System

How WodSmith organizes athletes into fair competitive groups.

## The Fairness Problem

CrossFit competitions attract diverse athletes: elite competitors and weekend warriors, 25-year-olds and 55-year-olds, men and women. Putting everyone in a single ranking wouldn't be fair or interesting.

Divisions solve this by creating groups where athletes compete against similar peers.

## Division Types

### Ability-Based Divisions

The most common split: RX vs Scaled.

**RX (Prescribed)**: Athletes perform movements as written with prescribed weights. Standards match competitive CrossFit.

**Scaled**: Modified movements and reduced weights make workouts accessible while maintaining intensity.

This split emerged from CrossFit's core philosophy: workouts should challenge everyone. A 315lb deadlift challenges an elite athlete; 185lb challenges someone newer to the sport. Both can compete meaningfully within their division.

**Intermediate divisions** fill the gap for athletes too advanced for Scaled but not ready for RX competition.

### Age-Based Divisions

Physical capacity changes with age. Age divisions acknowledge this reality:

- **Teen (14-17)**: Still developing athletes
- **Masters (35+)**: Age-grouped in 5-year brackets

Age divisions often combine with ability levels: Masters 40+ RX, Masters 40+ Scaled, etc.

### Gender Divisions

Men's and women's divisions recognize physiological differences in strength and power output. Prescribed weights differ accordingly.

The competitive CrossFit community continues evolving on gender inclusion. WodSmith supports configurable gender options to match competition policies.

### Team Divisions

Team competitions add coordination to physical challenge:

- **Pairs**: Two athletes share work
- **Teams of 4**: Larger groups with more strategic options
- **Mixed vs Same-Gender**: Different dynamics and requirements

Team divisions create unique experiences. Athletes succeed or fail together. Strategy matters alongside fitness.

## How Divisions Interact with Events

Divisions aren't just about rankings—they affect the workouts themselves.

### Division-Specific Standards

The same workout often has different requirements per division:

**Event: "Fran"**

| Division | Thrusters | Pull-ups |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| RX Male | 95 lb | Chest-to-bar |
| RX Female | 65 lb | Chest-to-bar |
| Scaled Male | 65 lb | Jumping |
| Scaled Female | 45 lb | Jumping |

WodSmith tracks these variations automatically. Athletes see their division's standards; judges know what to enforce.

### Shared vs Separate Events

Some competitions run identical workouts across divisions (varying only weights and standards). Others create entirely different workouts per division.

**Shared workout approach**:
- Simpler programming
- Easier comparison across divisions
- Constraints on movement selection

**Division-specific workouts**:
- Tailored to each group's capabilities
- More complex to manage
- Freedom in programming

## Division Capacity Management

### Setting Limits

Each division has a capacity: maximum athletes who can compete. This constraint comes from:

- **Space/time**: More athletes = longer event
- **Competitiveness**: Very large divisions dilute competition quality
- **Economics**: Registration fees, prize pools, etc.

### Waitlists

When a division fills, athletes join a waitlist. This creates:
- Prioritized backup if spots open
- Data on unmet demand (useful for future events)
- Clear communication about status

### Division Transfers

Athletes sometimes need to change divisions:
- Injury prevents RX standards
- Miscalculated ability level
- Category change (age, team composition)

WodSmith supports transfers with organizer approval. The audit trail tracks all changes.

## The Registration Flow

From an athlete's perspective, division selection happens during registration:

1. View available divisions
2. Read requirements/standards
3. Select appropriate division
4. Complete registration

**Design consideration**: Make requirements crystal clear. Athletes who register for the wrong division create problems for everyone.

## Division Strategy for Organizers

### How Many Divisions?

More divisions = More athletes accommodated + More complexity

The right answer depends on:
- Expected athlete count
- Competition format (single day vs weekend)
- Venue capacity
- Volunteer/judge availability

**Rule of thumb**: Start with fewer divisions. Expand only when demand clearly justifies complexity.

### Pricing by Division

Different divisions can have different entry fees:
- RX often costs more (implies more competitive, longer events)
- Team divisions cost more per person (larger prize pools)
- Age divisions sometimes discounted (community building)

WodSmith supports per-division pricing.

### Combining Divisions

When division registration is unexpectedly low, organizers might combine:
- Scaled Male + Scaled Female → Scaled Open
- Masters 50+ → Combined Masters (45+)

This maintains competitive fields while reducing scheduling complexity.

## Fairness Enforcement

Divisions only work when athletes compete within their declared capabilities.

### Standards Enforcement

Judges enforce movement standards per division. An athlete in Scaled who attempts RX movements receives no advantage.

### Verification

For age divisions, organizers may require:
- Birth date verification
- Government ID check

For ability divisions, some competitions use:
- Qualification standards
- Previous competition results
- Video submissions

### Disputes and Penalties

When athletes compete outside their division's standards:
- Penalties (time or rep additions)
- Score invalidation
- Disqualification

WodSmith tracks score adjustments and their reasons.

## The Future of Divisions

CrossFit competition continues evolving. Emerging patterns include:

- **Adaptive athlete divisions**: Athletes with physical disabilities
- **Algorithm-based handicapping**: Individual adjustments rather than broad categories
- **Open divisions**: Self-selected standards with normalized scoring

WodSmith's flexible division system accommodates experimentation while maintaining the fundamentals that make competition fair and engaging.
