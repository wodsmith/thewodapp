# Workouts

Create and manage workouts with full CrossFit scoring support.

## Workout Types

WodSmith supports all common CrossFit workout formats:

### AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)

Set a time cap and athletes complete as many rounds as possible:

```
12 Minute AMRAP:
- 10 Pull-ups
- 15 Push-ups
- 20 Air Squats
```

Scoring: Rounds + Reps (e.g., "5+12" = 5 rounds + 12 reps)

### For Time

Athletes race to complete the prescribed work:

```
For Time:
- 21-15-9
- Thrusters (95/65)
- Pull-ups
```

Scoring: Time to completion (e.g., "8:42")

### EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute)

Perform work at the start of each minute:

```
20 Minute EMOM:
Odd: 12 Wall Balls
Even: 8 Toes-to-Bar
```

### Strength

Track lifting sessions with sets, reps, and weights:

```
Back Squat
5x5 @ 80%
```
