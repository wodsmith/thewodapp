## Description

Implement utility functions to determine user permissions for workout editing and remixing. These functions will check if a user can edit a workout directly or if they need to create a remix.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 canUserEditWorkout function correctly determines if user owns the workout
- [x] #2 shouldCreateRemix function returns true when user should create remix instead of editing
- [x] #3 Functions are properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] #4 Utility functions exported from src/utils/workout-permissions.ts
- [x] #5 Functions handle team-based permissions correctly
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing user, team, and workout data models\n2. Review current authentication and permission patterns\n3. Create TypeScript interfaces for permission utilities\n4. Implement canUserEditWorkout function\n5. Implement shouldCreateRemix function with team logic\n6. Add proper exports and error handling\n7. Test all acceptance criteria


## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented workout permission utilities with three main functions: canUserEditWorkout, shouldCreateRemix, and getWorkoutPermissions. The implementation follows existing authentication patterns and uses team-based permissions to determine edit access. All functions are properly typed with TypeScript interfaces and exported from src/utils/workout-permissions.ts. The utilities handle team membership verification and prevent editing of remixed workouts.
