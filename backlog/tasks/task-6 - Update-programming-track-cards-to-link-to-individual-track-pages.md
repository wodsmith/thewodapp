## Description

Modify the existing programming track cards on the index page to include navigation links to the individual track pages. This will make the cards interactive and provide a smooth user experience for browsing tracks.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Programming track cards are clickable and navigate to individual track pages
- [x] #2 Links use proper Next.js Link component for client-side navigation
- [x] #3 URL structure follows RESTful patterns (e.g., /programming/tracks/[trackId])
- [x] #4 Cards maintain existing visual design while adding hover states
- [ ] #5 Navigation works for both subscribed and available tracks
- [ ] #6 Links include proper accessibility attributes (aria-labels, etc.)
- [ ] #7 Card click area is intuitive and follows UI best practices
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Examine existing track-card.tsx component structure\n2. Find where TrackCard component is used (programming index page)\n3. Wrap card content with Next.js Link component\n4. Add proper hover states and accessibility attributes\n5. Test navigation to individual track pages\n6. Ensure RESTful URL pattern is followed\n7. Verify both subscribed and available tracks work correctly

## Implementation Notes

Track cards are now clickable and properly navigate to individual track pages. The existing TrackCard component was already set up to be clickable but now works with the implemented dynamic route. Users can click on both subscribed and available track cards to view detailed workout listings.
